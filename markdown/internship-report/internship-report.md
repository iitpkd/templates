# Abstract
Taken from [this](https://scholarworks.uno.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1103&context=aa_rpts) report. 

This report describes the internship I spent at the Krasnodar Regional Center of Fine Arts in Russia. The Art Center is a leading fine arts organization in the Krasnodar Region of the Russian Federation and as such operates under the principles governing arts organization in Russia in general. I describe the managerial structure of the Art Center and responsibilities of each department, explain the specifics of the Art Center and the difficulties, problems and barriers that impact the functioning of the Art Center. I also present an in-depth analysis of the strengths and weaknesses as well as threats and opportunities available to the Art Center as identified through a SWOT analysis. After analyzing the four basic areas of this art organization including management, marketing, development and financial management, and comparing them to best practices in the field, I suggest recommendations to help remedy the weaknesses, emphasize the strengths and resolve identified problems. The steps required to implement the recommendations suggested are also presented. Finally I discuss the contribution to the Art Center including both its short and long-term effects of my participation on the organization.

# Introduction
Start here. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
