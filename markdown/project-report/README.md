## Generate a PDF from your MarkDown. 

* You could use [GitPrint](https://gitprint.com/). 
* [dilinger.io](https://dillinger.io/) is a handy tool too. 
* To print the github preview of a markdown file, have a look at [this gist](https://gist.github.com/ashutosh2411/a97c815edafa4cfd5a25c67db389f43a). Check out the comments for usage instructions. 
* As an exercise, try printing this [`README.md`](README.md) preview. 
* To work locally on MarkDown 
	* you can install the SublimeText3 plugin, [MarkdownLivePreview](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MarkdownLivePreview). 
	* use Markdown Preview style in [Marp](https://yhatt.github.io/marp/). _(preferred)_
