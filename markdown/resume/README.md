[`resume.md`](resume.md) is a resume template very close to the one specified by [IIT Palakkad](https://www.iitpkd.ac.in/).

* To print the github preview of a markdown file, have a look at [this gist](https://gist.github.com/ashutosh2411/a97c815edafa4cfd5a25c67db389f43a). Check out the comments for usage instructions.

* To work locally on MarkDown 
	* you can install the SublimeText3 plugin, [MarkdownLivePreview](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MarkdownLivePreview).
