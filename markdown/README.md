# MarkDown Templates
_contributed by: [Ashutosh Upadhye](https://github.com/ashutosh2411)_

* This folder contains templates for reports, presentations, and resume in MarkDown. 
* A simpler report is most of the times much appreciated. 

## Generate a PDF from your MarkDown. 

* You could use GitPrint. 
* [dilinger.io](https://dillinger.io/) is a handy tool too. 
* To print the github preview of a markdown file, have a look at [this gist](https://gist.github.com/ashutosh2411/a97c815edafa4cfd5a25c67db389f43a). Check out the comments for usage instructions. 
* As an exercise, try printing this [`README.md`](https://github.com/ashutosh2411/templates/blob/master/markdown/README.md) preview. 
* To work locally on MarkDown 
	* you can install the SublimeText3 plugin, [MarkdownLivePreview](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MarkdownLivePreview). 
	* use Markdown Preview style in [Marp](https://yhatt.github.io/marp/). _(preferred)_

## Generate Slides from your MarkDown.

* Use [Marp](https://github.com/yhatt/marp#usage).
* If you use Linux, you might wanna create a [desktop entry](https://gist.github.com/ashutosh2411/013949bdc3afd3695ab27ed67512c844) as well. 
* Check out [example md](/slides.md) file and the [rendered pdf](slides.pdf) file.
